/**
 * Provides a test framework with various convenience methods for OperaDriver.
 *
 * In particular it spawns an out-of-process web server holding fixture files, a storage of
 * pages/fixtures that can be used in tests, various ad-hoc resources (such as fake files,
 * executables, &c.), a storage for preserving OperaDriver instances cross test classes, and a set
 * of annotations that provide ignore rules and special actions.
 *
 * To use these features, make sure that the JUnit test class extends this class as such:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *   public class MyTest extends TestCaseImpl {
 *     â€¦
 *   }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * This test setup mimics the characteristics of the Selenium test framework making it easier to
 * exchange tests.
